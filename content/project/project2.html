<div id="purpose" class="section level3">
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project was to learn Shiny, R Studio’s powerful framework for packaging R code into web applications. With Shiny, the possibilities for communicating data are endless, including connecting to API’s or creating dashboards that update in real time. You might embed a machine learning model for producing results on the go, or track metrics that constantly update. I wanted to demonstrate these concepts with an exciting data source.</p>

<div id="technology-learned" class="section level3">
<h3>Technology Learned</h3>
<p>I learned R’s <code>Shiny</code> package. I learned fundamentals of Bootstrap and CSS, and how to parse JSON data as well. After sharing the development version with Microsoft’s (343 Industries) Halo API maintainers, I was granted access to a developer’s key to share this app with the worldwide Halo 5 community.</p>

<div id="about-the-app" class="section level3">
<h3>About the App</h3>
<p>Search for a player’s name, and this app will connect to Microsoft’s Halo 5 API, import their game data, and create beautiful charts for downloading. To use, try searching for Hairball9000 (or any other player) and toggle options relating to the graphical inputs.
