<p><strong>Deep, labored breathing</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, this is the opening post on my new blog, which I’m relocating from Wordpress to GitHub Pages and Netlify. It’s so nice I’ve given it a name - because nice things have names!</p>
<p>But, why was I <strong>panting</strong>? The relocation effort wasn’t easy. Why did I follow through with it? Becuase it is <strong>worth the effort</strong>. This post is evidence of my victory. Now please, let me explain.</p>
<p>A few months ago, when I explored options for creating a blog to help me keep track of my learning, and to display my progress (and creativity) to the world, I decided on Wordpress. It was convenient, quick to set up, and easy to forget about.</p>
<p>But Wordpress didn’t:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Display R code very well.</li>
<li>Highlight or display code in code blocks.</li>
<li>Provide <strong>exposure</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main purpose of a blog is to be seen, but my page at Wordpress was more of a hideout than a open facing space. I did some googling and found Blogdown. It is great, but in all honesty, migrating over was a <strong>struggle</strong>. I tried <a href="https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/">this process</a>, but ultimately found <a href="https://youtu.be/syWAKaj-4ck">this You Tube tutorial</a> the best. The general workflow was</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create GitHub account and Repo</p></li>
<li><p>Create new R Version Control Project (same name as repo I think)</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;&quot;)</code> to create a new site in R, and edit the config.toml file to change up some of the blog paramaters to your liking.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>blogdown::build_site</code></p></li>
<li><p>Commit/push to GitHub, then point to Netlify. (You’ll need to edit settings for repo to be a GitHub Page, for more details refer to John Muschelli’s tutorial on You Tube.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, it was all definitely <strong>FRUSTRATING</strong>. I had no experience with GitHub and found it very unintuitive. While wrangling my config.toml file (to change blog appearance), I experienced merge conflicts between my local files and my GitHub repo, and had no idea what to do. So, in the ultimate paradox of things, I was on a version control site wrestling against verson control paramaters. But I got my blog up and I’m very happy with the end result. I know that I can easily avoid future frustrations simply by learning about GitHub. Secondly, if I ever want to switch a layout, well, switching Hugo Themes seems very easy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ve seen lots of complaints about blogdown already. But, the best thing is that when you use it, <strong>you won’t ever have to manually update a blog again</strong> and you can simply stay in R, where the action is.</p>
<p>Next – I should probably migrate my old posts from the Wordpress grave.</p>
