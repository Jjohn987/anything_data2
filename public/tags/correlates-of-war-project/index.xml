      <description>I suddenly got bit by a bug to learn about network analysis. So I recalled the Correlates of War Project having a dataset about alliances. I decided to revisit them and download the data for this new project, which you can do too.
To start small, I decided to visualize a certain topic, e.g., European Defense Treaties relating to World War I. For that purpose I filtered the dataset for treaties that occured between 1878 and 1914.</description>
