      <description>Today I want to predict churn using data from a hypothetical telecom company. Although it isn’t real life data, it is based on real life data. The data are spread across 19 columns — 14 continuous, 4 categorical, and the outcome variable for prediction - “churn”. The dataset is small, with 3333 rows for training and 1667 for testing.
Before modeling, I need to explore the data structure – the distributions, class balances/imbalances, relationships between variables, etc.</description>

      <description>This post is following exercise 1 in Chapter 12 of Applied Predicative Modeling. Here I use the machine learning package CARET in R to make classification models; in particular, the linear classification models discussed in Chapter 12.
The dataset in question is about hepatic injury (liver damage). It includes a dataframe of biological related predictors of liver damage bio, a dataframe of chemical related predictors chem, and the response variable we are interested in, injury.</description>
